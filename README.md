How to Play
1. Each player takes turns rolling the die.
2. On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they want.
3. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn, and their turn ends.
4. If a player rolls any other number, they can add that number to their turn total and choose to roll again or hold.
5. If a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their overall score, and the turn passes to the next player.
6. The first player to reach the target score (default is 100) wins the game.
